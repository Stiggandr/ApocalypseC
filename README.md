Apocalypse is the final project created for CIS 252 C++ class. 
It is a console game utilyzing simple stat management of "Science", "Faith", and "Ethics" to preserve the population in an a world of ever worsening apocalyptic scenarios. 
It's intended to be campy, and pulpy, like an old scifi movie. 

Ways to help. 
Due to time constraints the "decks" of events and player decrees do not behave as literal decks. They are merely arrays populated with random number generators.
populating the "timeline" and "hand" arrays with a randomly filled stacks or queues acting as a deck would allow greater strategy in the game through card counting etc.

More events can be added on the Events.cpp page

More player decrees can be added on the PlayerCard.cpp page

More visual elements can be included to make it easier to read the stats.
